The office number is 1,
The address is 2643 Lugsi Dr.,

	2,
	775,
	'MA111'
);


Task 6: Delete all properties in the LARGE_PROPERTY table for which the owner number is BU106.

Task 8: Add to the LARGE_PROPERTY table a new character column named OCCUPIED that is one character in length. (This column indicates whether the property is currently occupied.)

ALTER TABLE LARGE_PROPERTY
ADD OCCUPIED CHAR(1);

UPDATE LARGE_PROPERTY
SET OCCUPIED = 'Y';

UPDATE LARGE_PROPERTY
SET OCCUPIED = 'N'
WHERE OWNER_NUM = 'KO104';
